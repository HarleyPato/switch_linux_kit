Root filesystems

If all went well, you should have some penguins. You should probably put a root filesystem on your SD card. Userspace libraries and other patches coming soon.

Here is an example on how to get Arch up and running.

    make a new MBR partition table on a fresh sdcard
    make two partitions on it
    format the second one as ext4
    mount that partition somewhere
    download Arch Linux ARM rootfs
    untar it into your partition as root.

Here are some example commands you should not just copy paste into your terminal.

$ mkdir -p /tmp/sdcard
$ mount -t ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p2 /tmp/sdcard
$ wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-aarch64-latest.tar.gz
$ sudo tar -xf ArchLinuxARM-aarch64-latest.tar.gz -C /tmp/sdcard
$ sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p2
